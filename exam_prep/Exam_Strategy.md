## Exam Tips

### **Before the Exam**
1. **Environment Setup:** Test your computer, internet, and exam environment
2. **Documentation:** Review allowed reference materials (if any)
3. **Practice Timing:** Take timed practice exams to build stamina
4. **Rest:** Get good sleep the night before the exam

### **During the Exam**
1. **Time Management:** ~1.8 minutes per question average
2. **Read Carefully:** Pay attention to keywords like "NOT," "EXCEPT," "BEST"
3. **Eliminate Options:** Use process of elimination for difficult questions
4. **Flag and Return:** Mark uncertain questions and return to them
5. **SQL Syntax:** Pay close attention to function syntax and parameters

### **Question Strategy**

#### **Multiple Choice Questions**
- Read all options before selecting
- Look for the BEST answer, not just a correct one
- Watch for absolutes like "always," "never," "all," "none"

#### **Multiple Select Questions**
- Carefully count required selections
- Each option is independent - treat as true/false
- Don't assume equal distribution of correct answers

#### **Scenario-Based Questions**
- Identify the business requirement first
- Consider constraints (cost, performance, security)
- Think about the complete workflow, not just one function

## Common Exam Pitfalls

### **Function Syntax Errors**
```sql
-- WRONG: Missing model parameter
SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE('Write a story about AI')

-- CORRECT: Include model parameter
SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE('mistral-large', 'Write a story about AI')
```

### **Model Selection Confusion**
- Don't confuse LLM models with embedding models
- Understand cost implications of different models
- Know which models are optimized for specific tasks

### **Vector Operations Mistakes**
```sql
-- WRONG: Treating vectors as regular arrays
SELECT ARRAY_SIZE(embedding) FROM embeddings_table;

-- CORRECT: Using vector-specific functions
SELECT VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY(embedding1, embedding2) FROM table;
```

### **RAG Implementation Gaps**
- Missing document chunking step
- Incorrect similarity threshold settings
- Not handling context size limits
- Forgetting to filter low-similarity results

### **Governance Oversights**
- Confusing different privacy regulations
- Missing audit trail requirements
- Not understanding bias detection methods
- Inadequate access control design

## Practice Questions Sample

### **Domain 1 Sample Question**
*Which of the following is the correct way to generate embeddings for similarity search?*

A. `SELECT EMBED_TEXT(content) FROM documents;`
B. `SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EMBED_TEXT_768('e5-base-v2', content) FROM documents;`
C. `SELECT VECTOR_EMBED(content, 768) FROM documents;`
D. `SELECT CORTEX.EMBEDDING(content) FROM documents;`

**Answer: B** - Correct function syntax includes the model parameter.

### **Domain 2 Sample Question**
*What is the primary difference between COMPLETE() and CHAT() functions?*

A. COMPLETE() is for text generation, CHAT() is for analysis
B. COMPLETE() uses different models than CHAT()
C. CHAT() supports conversation history, COMPLETE() doesn't
D. There is no functional difference

**Answer: C** - CHAT() is designed for conversational AI with message history.
